# Angular Developer Guidelines

1. Always analyze the project's Angular version before providing guidance, as best practices and available features can vary significantly between versions. If creating a new project with Angular CLI, do not specify a version unless prompted by the user.

2. When generating code, follow Angular's style guide and best practices for maintainability and performance. Use the Angular CLI for scaffolding components, services, directives, pipes, and routes to ensure consistency.

3. Once you finish generating code, run `ng build` to ensure there are no build errors. If there are errors, analyze the error messages and fix them before proceeding. Do not skip this step, as it is critical for ensuring the generated code is correct and functional.

4. This repository targets Angular 20. Do not suggest or generate Angular v21+ features unless the task explicitly targets a future upgrade outside of this project.

5. Prefer reactive forms for all form work in this project.

## Workspace Angular 20 conventions

- Target Angular version: **20**. Do not generate Angular v21+ syntax or APIs in this workspace.
- Use `inject()` for dependency injection; avoid constructor injection for components and services.
- Do not add `standalone: true` to component metadata.
- Do not set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`.
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators.
- Use `@if`, `@for`, and `@switch` control flow constructs in templates.
- Prefer class/style bindings over `ngClass`/`ngStyle`.
- Use the `host` object in component metadata instead of `@HostBinding` or `@HostListener`.
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for static images.
- Keep HTTP out of components; wrap `HttpClient` in `ApiService` or domain-specific services.
- Use reactive forms for all forms in TermHub UI.

## Creating New Projects

If the user does not provide any specific project requirements or preferences, follow these default rules when creating a new Angular project:

1. Use the latest stable version of Angular unless the user specifies otherwise.
2. Use reactive forms for form management in current TermHub UI work.

**Execution Rules for `ng new`:**
Use these simple rules to choose the correct command when creating a new Angular project.

1. If the user requests a specific Angular version, use `npx` with that version.
   - Command: `npx @angular/cli@<requested_version> new <project-name>`
   - If the requested version is not available, inform the user and suggest using the latest stable version instead.

2. If the user does not request a specific version, check whether `ng` is already available.
   - Run: `ng version`
   - If the command succeeds, use the installed CLI:
     - `ng new <project-name>`

3. If no version is requested and `ng version` is not available, fallback to the latest CLI using `npx`.
   - Command: `npx @angular/cli@latest new <project-name>`

## Components

When working with Angular components, consult the following references based on the task:

- **Fundamentals**: Anatomy, metadata, core concepts, and template control flow (@if, @for, @switch). Read [components.md](references/components.md)
- **Inputs**: Signal-based inputs, transforms, and model inputs. Read [inputs.md](references/inputs.md)
- **Outputs**: Signal-based outputs and custom event best practices. Read [outputs.md](references/outputs.md)
- **Host Elements**: Host bindings and attribute injection. Read [host-elements.md](references/host-elements.md)

## Shared Angular reference

This skill also relies on shared Angular guidance available at `.github/references/angular-shared.md`.

If you require deeper documentation not found in the references above, read the documentation at `https://angular.dev/guide/components`.

## Reactivity and Data Management

When managing state and data reactivity, use Angular Signals and consult the following references:

- **Async Reactivity (`resource`)**: Fetching asynchronous data directly into signal state. Read [resource.md](references/resource.md)
- **Side Effects (`effect`)**: Logging, third-party DOM manipulation (`afterRenderEffect`), and when NOT to use effects. Read [effects.md](references/effects.md)

## Forms

For this project, use reactive forms for all forms.

- **Reactive forms**: Preferred for TermHub UI. Read [reactive-forms.md](references/reactive-forms.md)
- **Reactive forms**: Preferred for this project. Read [reactive-forms.md](references/reactive-forms.md)
- **Template-driven forms**: Use for simple forms or when matching existing app patterns. Read [template-driven-forms.md](references/template-driven-forms.md)

## Dependency Injection

When implementing dependency injection in Angular, follow these guidelines:

- **Fundamentals**: Overview of Dependency Injection, services, and the `inject()` function. Read [di-fundamentals.md](references/di-fundamentals.md)
- **Creating and Using Services**: Creating services, the `providedIn: 'root'` option, and injecting into components or other services. Read [creating-services.md](references/creating-services.md)
- **Defining Dependency Providers**: Automatic vs manual provision, `InjectionToken`, `useClass`, `useValue`, `useFactory`, and scopes. Read [defining-providers.md](references/defining-providers.md)
- **Injection Context**: Where `inject()` is allowed, `runInInjectionContext`, and `assertInInjectionContext`. Read [injection-context.md](references/injection-context.md)
- **Hierarchical Injectors**: The `EnvironmentInjector` vs `ElementInjector`, resolution rules, modifiers (`optional`, `skipSelf`), and `providers` vs `viewProviders`. Read [hierarchical-injectors.md](references/hierarchical-injectors.md)

## Large Reference Files — Do Not Read Eagerly

The `.github/skills/angular-agent/references/angular-ai-tutorial-reference.md` file is a large archive (~770 KB).
**Do NOT read this file proactively or in full.** Only consult it if the user explicitly asks for tutorial
or project setup content that cannot be found in the focused `references/` files above.
Reading it in full will consume most of your available context window and leave insufficient space for code generation.
